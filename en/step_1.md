## You will make

Do you ever wonder if you have had a good night's sleep?

In this project, you are going to make a sleep tracker that will display how rested you are. 
You can run the program on your micro:bit when it is placed under your pillow, so it can track your sleep movements.

<p style="border-left: solid; border-width:10px; border-color: #0faeb0; background-color: aliceblue; padding: 10px;">

Keeping <span style="color: #0faeb0">track</span> of how well you sleep can be really helpful. When we pay attention to things like if we move a lot during the night, we can learn how to sleep even better. Sleeping better makes our brains work better, helps us feel happier, and keeps our bodies healthier. Using special tools to track our sleep can teach us how to sleep in the best way, so we feel refreshed every morning!

You will:
+ Use your micro:bit to monitor your sleep movements
+ Use variables to track your sleep movements
+ Display the movements on the micro:bit's LEDs
+ Use buttons and logic to reset the tracker and control the brightness of the LED display
+ Use a loop to create an animation
+ Organise your code using a function
