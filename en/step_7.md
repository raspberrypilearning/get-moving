Great work! You have created your micro:bit sleep tracker. Here are some ideas to upgrade your project and create a more advanced sleep tracker:

![TODO: Update these and include V2 options]()
+ Snoring - microphone v2 upgrade
+ Track the time 
+ Change the Zs message
+ Change the number of max events
+ Display an overall rating rather than a number of events
+ Log sleep events using v2
+ Power save - turn LEDs brightness on and off with tilt up and down

![TODO: Decide about adding a 'play' icon when play melody called (and stop when first shake)]()

![TODO: Add upgrade embed]()
